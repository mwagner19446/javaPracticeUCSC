/**
 * This is a solution for the Final for CMPR.x412 at UCSC for Beginning Java. 
 * 
 * The LetterGrader class has five public methods and three private subclasses  
 *  
 * The readScore method reads the input file and stores the scores in the Score Array. 
 * The calcLetterGrade reads the scores from the Score Array and calculates a Letter grade
 * The printLetterGrade method prints the Letter grade to the Output file. 
 * The displayAverages calculates the average, min, and max scores for the quizzes and exams and prints them in the console. 
 * The doCleanup closes all the open streams that were used throughout.   
 * 
 * The LetterGrade private class manages the functions and data around the letterGrades for the Students. 
 * The Scores private class manages the functions and the data around the scores for each exam and quiz.  
 * The Analytics private class manages the functions and the data around average, min, and max scores for each quiz and exam.  
 *   
 * Requirements and Assumptions: 
 * The program assumes the input file will structure its rows with 8 tokens (and 7 delimiters).  
 * It assumes the delimiters will be commas. 
 * It will accept any number of rows. 
 * If there are not 8 tokens, the program will skip the line
 * If the final 7 tokens are not numeric (These were intended to be scores), the program will change the value to 0.
